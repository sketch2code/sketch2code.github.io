  <p>
        Generating code from images, and in particular sketches, has
        recently emerged as an exciting research area in machine learning
        and software engineering.
  </p>
  <p>
      We present <b>sketch2code</b>, a framework that automatically
      generates code from pictures of hand-drawn sketches. In addition to
      shipping with built-in libraries, <b>sketch2code</b> also supports the addition
      of user-defined libraries and sketch symbols, which allows it to have a
      much wider range of applications than that of current systems.
  </p>
  <p>
      We achieve this goal by intelligently parsing the input sketch
      and then deterministically mapping the detected contents to a target
      library of the userâ€™s choice.
  </p>
  <h2>Results</h2>
  <p>
      To demonstrate the capabilities of our framework, we implement two target
      libraries, one for Qt and one for Alice 3.
</p>
<p>
      In the images below, the left
      image represents the hand-drawn sketch, and the right image corresponds
      to the compiled code that <b>sketch2code</b> spits out.
